# Fedora Remix Tools

Fedora Remix Tools is the next evolution of the YAD Fedora Remix Scripts. This set of tools is meant to replace the "YAD" interface and BASH scripts with a Qt5 Python application for launching and controlling the Remix Tools and applications. The new method is capable of being configured entirely with the **config.yml** file and will take and accept changes on the next launch of the application.
